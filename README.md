## About

Delicious + Instapaper + Flipboard

I want content to be automatically captured and placed into a format I can browse offline.

Pigeon will monitor a gmail address, extract the content, and create a magazine I can read offline.

Uses bookmarklets to get data to the main site

Search works on titles. Soon expanded to full text searches using elastic search
